# TickX Tech Test

This project was completed as part of a tech test required by TickX. It was created mainly using `ReactJS` and `Typescript`.

My approach was to create reusable components that are simple, scalable and easy to work with, making it easier to add more functionality if its needed in the future.

The app was developed with the following in mind:

- Responsiveness
- Accessibility
- Simplicity
- Scalability

## Styles

Styling was done using `Sass` pre-processor and `Modular CSS`.

## Tests

Tests were done using `React testing library`.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for the opportunity to do this tech test, I really hope you can fine some value on it. I enjoyed it and I would have loved to have more time to develop it further and better.

## Further development

- I would have unit tested all components as much as possible.
- I would have made integration tests.
- I would have tested API requests.
- I think context or redux would have helped managing states better.
- I would have added video items and implemented a media player to render them.
- I would have done better types for typscript on some functions and components.
- I would have implemented more accessibility features
