# TickX Tech Test

This project was completed as part of a tech test required by TickX. It was created mainly using `ReactJS` and `Typescript`.

My approach was to create reusable components that are simple, scalable and easy to work with, making it easier to add more functionality if its needed in the future.

The app was developed with the following in mind:

- Responsiveness
- Accessibility
- Simplicity
- Scalability

## Styles

Styling was done using `Sass` pre-processor and `Modular CSS`.

## Tests

Tests were done using `React testing library`.
